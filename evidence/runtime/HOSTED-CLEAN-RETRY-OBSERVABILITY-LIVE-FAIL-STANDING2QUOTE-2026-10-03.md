## Checks

- root test run `37153482193`: **PASS**
- Cloudflare Worker CI run `37153482173`: **PASS**
- Orca devnet discovery run `37153482180`: **PASS / READ-ONLY**
- authorized operator-lab live run `37153482247`: **FAIL**
- live job `111291962294`

## Exact live failure

Runtime before canonical sequence:
- status: `READY`
- network: `solana-devnet`
- Program ID: `7pgPuPZSUUtFcvFtVGmS3piCE1bHY35kjb14vct9v45Z`
- delegate: `4VLFryH36ed8Mc7ByBMLwvtrtYMgo2hKmAicDU2oRfj7`
- Mandate version: `14`
- Mandate nonce: `13`
- spentThisPeriod: `5000000`
- spentThisPeriodNotionalMicroUsd: `4999871`
- input vault: `1500000`
- output vault: `12698674`

Completed phases before failure:
- `BOOTSTRAP_READY`
- `STATE_LOAD`
- `ORCA_CONTEXT`
- `STANDING_1_MARKET_EVIDENCE`
- `STANDING_1_QUOTE`
- `STANDING_1_EXECUTE`
- `STANDING_2_MARKET_EVIDENCE`

Failure:
- phase: `STANDING_2_QUOTE`
- phase kind: `READ`
- failure class: `UNKNOWN_RUNTIME`
- reason code: `WORLD_FAIR_RUNTIME_FAILURE`
- retry policy: `NOT_AUTOMATICALLY_RETRYABLE`

Confirmed effect before failure:
- label: `standingAutonomy.1`
- signature: `ttsTwumZDbZGf55mHNpyhhdSshji59jLc5wYnEa1GVY88YJrTf6zke3MpzZ1DWp9esfwEGYjmLaj2dHWGdGhPXo`

Runtime reconciliation after failure:
- status: `READY`
- Mandate version: `14`
- Mandate nonce: `13`
- spentThisPeriod: `5200000`
- spentThisPeriodNotionalMicroUsd: `5199869`
- input vault: `1300000`
- output vault: `12898653`
- reconciliation error: none

Observed state delta across this run:
- spentThisPeriod: `+200000`
- spentThisPeriodNotionalMicroUsd: `+199998`
- input vault: `-200000`
- output vault: `+199979`
- Mandate nonce: unchanged

This exactly matches the confirmed first standing-autonomy execution and proves a nonzero partial effect.

## Failure evidence artifact

Artifact:
- id: `11285206479`
- name: `worlds-fair-operator-lab-runtime-receipt`
- digest: `sha256:19cbf99083fb7bd69d830e466d5521855736c5adc14660b3d92793abda27076a`
- size: `2024 bytes`

The clean observability repair therefore succeeded in its evidence objective:
- diagnostic persisted;
- partial progress persisted;
- confirmed effect signature persisted;
- runtime before/after persisted;
- state reconciliation persisted.

No blind replay is permitted.

## Interpretation

The read-retry ownership change is not sufficient to make the full canonical sequence reliable.

The new evidence moves the bottleneck precisely to the **second Orca quote after a confirmed first swap**. The failure happens after fresh Pyth evidence for standing action 2, so the immediate boundary is the Orca quote/read path, not the Pyth evidence fetch.

The current quote implementation refreshes and reuses the same long-lived Whirlpool object after a state-changing swap. A future source-only repair should test reacquiring a fresh Whirlpool/pool snapshot for each quote attempt so post-write quotes do not depend on stale object state.

This is an engineering hypothesis until non-live tests and a separately authorized live validation prove it.

## Automatic second Devnet workflow conflict

Opening PR #20 also automatically triggered:
- workflow: `worlds-fair-orca-devnet-proof`
- run: `37153482170`
- job: `111291961939`

This workflow is capable of executing a separate live Orca vertical slice on Solana Devnet. That is outside the explicit authorization because the user allowed only one live 7/7.

At the latest observation:
- status: `IN_PROGRESS`
- current step: `Install Anchor CLI 0.32.1`
- `Run first live Orca vertical slice`: **PENDING / NOT YET EXECUTED**

The available GitHub connector does not expose a workflow-cancel mutation. Manual cancellation was requested immediately.

The read-only `worlds-fair-orca-devnet-discovery` workflow is not an additional write/live sequence.
