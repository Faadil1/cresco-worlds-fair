Date: 2026-10-03  
Status: **MERGED + CLOUDFLARE DEPLOYED**  
Hosted repeatability: **NOT YET RE-PROVEN**

## Exact source promotion

- product repository: `Faadil1/cresco`
- PR: #15 — `Harden World’s Fair live-run reliability and observability`
- authorized exact head: `e868b1522c9fa28486777e3805f52a4c5d27093e`
- merge commit: `0ef9dc9618d9cbdfac1e714b7349993f4292aff9`

Authorized scope:
- merge PR #15 at the exact proven head;
- redeploy affected CRESCO Cloudflare Workers only for the reliability / observability repair.

## Cloudflare production builds

Backend:
- Worker: `keys-api-stocklana`
- result: **SUCCESS**
- build id: `a3a7d586-8392-417f-a574-744e340ee469`

Frontend:
- Worker: `cresco`
- result: **SUCCESS**
- build id: `2b755dc6-b38e-4a75-a5d1-d91ce01104fd`

Legacy:
- `Cloudflare Pages / cresco-visual-lab` remains failed/obsolete and is not the current CRESCO frontend runtime.

## Merge checks

## Read-only hosted smoke

A separate read-only verification was run after deployment.

Workflow:
- repository: `Faadil1/cresco-worlds-fair`
- run: `37128446709`
- job: `111218484824`
- result: **PASS**

Observed:
- public `/worlds-fair` route: HTTP 200
- public `GET /api/v0.3/worlds-fair/runtime`: HTTP 200
- runtime status: `READY`
- network: `solana-devnet`
- Program ID: `7pgPuPZSUUtFcvFtVGmS3piCE1bHY35kjb14vct9v45Z`
- live authority sequence in this smoke: **NOT EXECUTED**

## Protected boundary

The merge/redeploy authorization is consumed.

This authorization did **not** include additional Devnet execution after deployment.

A separate legacy workflow `devnet-execution-bridge` was auto-triggered by the merge because `src/http-api.mjs` changed. At the time this receipt was written:
- run: `37128260113`
- job: `111217931150`
- status: **IN PROGRESS**
- current step: `Build client IDL only`
- `Bootstrap stable demo runtime`: not yet started
- `Execute real HTTP-to-devnet smoke`: not yet started

This run is outside the merge/redeploy authorization if it proceeds into Devnet writes. It should be cancelled before those steps unless a separate human authorization is granted.

## Truth boundary

The reliability / observability repair is now deployed publicly.

Stable hosted self-serve reliability remains **PARTIAL / INTERMITTENT** until multiple post-deploy hosted browser attempts succeed.

No additional live Devnet run, mainnet action, custody change, adoption, WTP or external-human validation is proven by this deployment receipt.
