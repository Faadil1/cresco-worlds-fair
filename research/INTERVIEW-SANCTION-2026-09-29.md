## Evidence boundary

Eric is the founder/builder of Sanction and was open, collaborative and positive about CRESCO.

This interview can establish:
- Sanction design intent;
- observed product behavior;
- founder reasoning;
- open technical/product questions;
- explicit non-goals;
- relationship/collaboration signals.

It cannot establish:
- CRESCO customer demand;
- willingness to pay;
- adoption;
- recurring operator behavior;
- user preference for exact vs session exceptions;
- a moat.

Use:
- OBSERVED_PRODUCT_BEHAVIOR
- ERIC_DESIGN_DECISION
- TESTING_SIGNAL
- FOUNDER_REACTION
- RELATIONSHIP_SIGNAL
- INFERENCE
- UNKNOWN

## 1. CRESCO framing was understood

Faadil explained the original CRESCO model:
- parent sets a standing boundary;
- child acts independently within it;
- action beyond the boundary is blocked;
- parent may authorize a specific exception without permanently changing standing rules.

Eric understood the authority framing and related it to finite / temporal / one-off authorization structures.

Classification:
**FOUNDER_REACTION / CONCEPT_COMPREHENSION**

This is useful external comprehension evidence, not customer validation.

---

## 2. Sanction sees finite / temporal / one-off authority as a natural shape

Eric said that finite, temporal and one-off structures are similar to how Sanction is structured because the requests are finite.

He also demonstrated an escalation flow in the Sanction UX with a threshold breach and a time-bounded one-use grant.

Classification:
**ERIC_DESIGN_DECISION / OBSERVED_PRODUCT_BEHAVIOR**

Do not infer:
- that exact-once is the preferred market shape;
- that sessions are inferior;
- that CRESCO should lock exact-once everywhere.

---

## 3. Stale approvals are a real concern

Faadil asked what should happen when:
- a grant is approved under one policy state;
- the standing policy changes before redemption.

Eric's response:
- he would not silently rewrite the approval;
- revalidation / rewriting the ticket is something he would need to reason through;
- if a parent adds a hard restriction or freeze, he would probably block the earlier approval;
- he said the change should belong in redemption;
- explicit revocation should invalidate for sure.

Important nuance:
Eric did **not** state that every policy revision should invalidate every grant.

The useful design distinction is therefore likely:
- compatible/non-material change;
- tightening/hard restriction/freeze;
- explicit revocation.

Classification:
**ERIC_DESIGN_REASONING / TESTING_SIGNAL**

### CRESCO implication

CRESCO's current blanket nonce-staleness rule is safe but may be more rigid than necessary for some future verticals.

Do not weaken it yet.

Discovery question becomes:

> Which standing-authority changes are materially incompatible with an outstanding exception?

Potential future semantics:
- ALL_REVISION_STALE;
- HARDENING_ONLY_STALE;
- RELEVANT_DIMENSION_STALE;
- EXPLICIT_REVOKE_ONLY;
- REEVALUATE_AT_REDEMPTION.

No choice is locked.

## 4. Eric named three approval → execution failure classes

### A. Stale approval

Policy, revocation or authority state may change before the approved action executes.

### B. Action drift

The action actually performed can differ from the action the human thought they approved.

Eric's example:
an agent might be approved to spend a fixed amount on one design task, while the money is actually consumed by something materially different.

This directly reinforces:
- exact semantic binding;
- trusted action representation;
- mutation refusal;
- execution-time validation.

### C. Unknown outcome / duplicate risk

An action can succeed while the response is lost.

Blind retry can duplicate the action.

Eric also highlighted the inverse:
- authority can be consumed;
- downstream execution can fail;
- the grant is used but the intended effect did not happen.

His framing:

> Do not mistake approved for done.

Classification:
**ERIC_DESIGN_REASONING / FAILURE-MODE CONFIRMATION**

### CRESCO implication

The distinction between:
- approval;
- authority consumption;
- execution;
- observed completion

is material.

This strongly supports keeping a formal execution-state model and recovery path.

---

## 5. Recovery after consumed authority + uncertain outcome remains partly ambiguous

Eric said during the failure-mode discussion that recovery would need **fresh authority** while ensuring the action is not repeated.

Later, when asked whether the safest behavior is reconciliation, never automatic retry, or asking for a new approval, the exchange became linguistically inconsistent:
- Eric first said he would not ask for a new one;
- then after Faadil restated “ask for a new approval,” Eric answered yes.

Because those two statements conflict, do not encode a definitive product rule from this exchange.

Safe conclusion:
- blind automatic retry is dangerous;
- duplicate prevention matters;
- recovery needs explicit review/reconciliation;
- fresh authority may be required;
- exact UX/authorization semantics remain UNKNOWN.

Classification:
**AMBIGUOUS / REVIEW_REQUIRED**

---

## 6. Atomic authorization + execution was NOT validated

Faadil asked whether, if Sanction controlled the final executor, Eric would ideally want grant consumption and the external effect to become one atomic transition.

Eric did not answer this directly.

He instead discussed:
- how Sanction may be configured over time;
- high-stakes real-time decisions;
- large numbers of agents;
- budget/control problems;
- a concrete Anthropic billing-limit experience.

Therefore:

**Atomic execution remains a CRESCO technical residual, but Eric did not validate its desirability.**

Do not write:
- “Eric wants atomic execution.”
- “Sanction plans atomic settlement.”
- “The interview validated CRESCO atomicity.”

Classification:
**UNKNOWN**

---

## 7. Eric gave a concrete personal boundary event

Eric described waking up to an Anthropic notification that a $50 charge could not be processed after an agent had hit a limit / budget wall.

He used this as an example of why he wants control over autonomous agent spending.

This is a concrete founder/operator-adjacent anecdote, but:
- it is one person's experience;
- it is not Sanction customer data;
- it is not CRESCO WTP evidence.

Classification:
**FOUNDER PERSONAL NEGATIVE EVENT**

Potential relevance:
- budget boundaries around autonomous agents are real in Eric's own workflow;
- the need for control is not purely hypothetical.

Do not promote REAL_USER/WTP from this anecdote.

---

## 8. Minimum approval explanation is still not resolved

Faadil asked for the smallest explanation an approver needs.

Eric emphasized:
- clear preset variables;
- clear rules;
- finite/specific policies;
- scoped agent clearances;
- visibility into which policies/credentials/gateways apply.

He showed the agent roster / policy configuration surface.

However, he did not answer whether an approver needs:
- a complete Policy Diff;
- one fired rule;
- only action/consequence;
- a richer audit trail after the decision.

Therefore:
**Policy Diff demand remains UNPROVEN.**

The safer product hypothesis is:

> Decision-time explanation should be minimal and decision-relevant; richer policy evidence can remain available for audit.

Classification:
**PARTIAL SIGNAL / DEMAND UNKNOWN**

---

## 9. Sanction's explicit non-goal is the strongest interview finding

Faadil asked what Sanction deliberately chooses not to solve.

Eric answered clearly:
- Sanction is not solving actual fiduciary execution;
- it does not pass money;
- financial transfer is out of scope;
- Sanction wants to be governance;
- Sanction is about decisions, some of which may be financial;
- it wants to be a ledger, not a bank.

This is a direct boundary between Sanction and a possible CRESCO capital-path product.

Classification:
**ERIC_EXPLICIT_PRODUCT_BOUNDARY**

### CRESCO implication

The generic Agent Authorization lane remains crowded.

But a narrower residual becomes stronger:

> **Execution-bound delegated capital authority**, where CRESCO is not only the approval ledger but also controls the governed capital path.

This is not automatically a company or moat.

It is, however, a cleaner adjacency than “another agent authorization plane.”

---

## 10. Eric sees room for layered authority

Faadil asked whether parts of the authorization lifecycle belong at:
- executor;
- wallet;
- capital layer.

Eric said he likes the direction and sees room for different layers of authority/governance as Sanction gets configured.

He described a future where a team leader could govern many people/agents/tools through a common authorization plan.

This supports the idea that authorization may be layered rather than owned entirely by one product.

Classification:
**FOUNDER_ARCHITECTURE_VIEW**

Do not treat it as:
- endorsement of CRESCO architecture;
- proof that a separate capital layer will sell;
- proof of integration demand.

---

## 11. Relationship / collaboration signal is unusually strong

Eric:
- offered to help figure out technical problems;
- offered to take passes on a repo;
- asked to meet Faadil's partner;
- said connections should be made;
- offered to think of operator-side / dev-shop referrals;
- invited future idea exchange;
- said he would send follow-up thoughts.

Classification:
**RELATIONSHIP_SIGNAL / POTENTIAL TECHNICAL COLLABORATION**

This is strategically useful.

It is not:
- customer validation;
- adoption;
- a partnership agreement;
- a commitment to contribute code.

# Agent-lane kill/save test after interview

## What was weakened

Generic positioning such as:
- “authorization for AI agents”;
- “human approvals for autonomous agents”;
- “one-use grants”;
- “policy governance”;
- “agent spend controls”

remains poor territory for CRESCO because Sanction directly occupies it.

## What survived more clearly

### 1. Execution-bound capital authority
Sanction explicitly does not want to be the fiduciary execution layer.

### 2. Stale-authority semantics
Sanction acknowledges this as a real design concern, though the correct semantic is not settled.

### 3. Action integrity
Binding approval to the actual executed action matters.

### 4. Completion/recovery state
Approved ≠ consumed ≠ executed ≠ observed complete.

### 5. Layered authority
A governance plane and a capital execution layer can plausibly coexist.

## What remains unproven

- that users will pay for this separation;
- that onchain atomicity is materially valuable;
- that operators want CRESCO rather than a wallet/module feature;
- that exact exceptions beat sessions/envelopes;
- that Policy Diff matters at decision time.

# Recommended next actions

1. Treat Eric as a high-value expert/collaborator relationship.
2. Send the promised synthesis after a few more interviews.
3. Ask for the operator/dev-shop referrals he offered.
4. Continue Squads / Primer / Ellipsis / Ergonia / Session discovery.
5. Test the strongest residual directly:
   - governance/authorization plane
   - vs execution-bound capital authority.
6. Ask operators:
   > Who owns the final authority at execution time, and what happens if approval becomes stale before capital moves?
7. Do not Concept Lock until at least two operator-side workflows confirm material pain and trial interest.
